# Organised Collections

### <mark style="color:orange;">What are Organised Collections?</mark>

Organised collections are a feature in Sunbird ED that allow creators to group and organize assets in a structured manner for easy discovery and consumption by users. Collections can be categorized into different types such as:

* Courses
* Textbooks
* Playlists
* Episodes
* Web series
* TV Classes

There are two types of collections:

1. **Trackable Collection**: These collections enable tracking of user consumption behavior and metadata. Examples include courses, TV shows, training materials, and collections with assessments.
2. **Non-Trackable Collection**: These collections do not track user consumption data. Examples include textbooks and playlists.

Collections are grouped under "Primary Categories" metadata, which helps users discover and consume content more easily.

### <mark style="color:orange;">Why do you need to organise collections?</mark>

Organising assets into a collection makes the asset easily discoverable for the platform users. Collections can also be attached with certain behavioural, discoverable metadata.

Organizing collections is important for several reasons:

1. **Discoverability**: By organizing collections, you make it easier for users to find and access the content they need. Collections act as a structured way to categorize and group related assets, making it more efficient for users to discover and navigate through the content.
2. **Contextualization**: Organized collections provide context and relevance to the content. By linking assets within a collection, you create a logical flow and structure, allowing users to understand the relationships between different pieces of content.
3. **Personalization**: By tagging and categorizing collections, you can target specific frameworks or user preferences, ensuring that the right content reaches the right users based on their individual needs and preferences.
4. **Tracking and Progress**: This feature facilitates personalized learning journeys and provides insights into user behavior and engagement.

### <mark style="color:orange;">How can you use Organised Collections?</mark>

Organised Collections in Sunbird provide the capability to group assets together into collections, making them easily discoverable for platform users.&#x20;

Here's how you can use Organised Collections:

1. **Categorize Assets**: You can create various categories of collections based on your solution or domain needs. For example, you can create collections like courses, textbooks, playlists, etc.
2. **Hierarchy Organization**: Organize your assets in a multi-level hierarchy by creating folders and grouping assets under them. Each level of the hierarchy can have one or more folders.
3. **Metadata Tagging**: Tag metadata at the collection level, folder level, and asset level to ensure efficient organization and discoverability. Metadata attributes can be configured based on your requirements.
4. **Trackable vs Non-Trackable Collections**: Decide whether a collection should be trackable or non-trackable. Trackable collections enable tracking user consumption data, while non-trackable collections exclude this data.
5. **Collection Editor**: Use the Collection Editor tool, an Angular Typescript-based editor, to create and edit collections. This tool allows you to create multiple assets and organize them as structured collections.

By utilizing Organised Collections, you can effectively manage and present your assets in a structured manner, enhancing the discoverability and consumption experience for users.
