# Verifiable Credentials

### <mark style="color:orange;">What are Verifiable Credentials?</mark>

Verifiable credentials are digital certificates that can be used to assert user information securely and privately. They are derived from components of Sunbird RC and have QR codes that can be used to verify user information further. These credentials are designed to provide the same benefits as physical credentials, such as driver's licenses and university degrees, but in a digital format.

### Why Do You Need a Verifiable Credential?

Verifiable credentials are necessary for several reasons:

1. **Secure and Private Information**: They ensure user information is stored and transmitted securely and privately, without compromising the user's identity.
2. **Machine-Verifiable**: Verifiable credentials can be machine-verifiable, making it easier to establish trust at a distance.
3. **Long-Term Claims**: They support longer-term claims, which can persist and be valid over longer periods, ensuring that the information remains valid even after the initial issuance

Verifiable Credentials represent a significant leap forward in digital identity verification, enabling users to secure and share proof of their qualifications, memberships, and competencies through a digitally verifiable format. Unlike traditional documents, these credentials are issued as digital certificates, often incorporating QR codes for easy verification. This modern approach not only streamlines the process of credential verification for the holder but also enhances security, reduces the potential for fraud, and offers a more efficient mechanism for organizations and institutions to confirm the authenticity of an individualâ€™s claims. With platforms like SunbirdED facilitating the issuance, management, and sharing of these digital certificates, users gain unprecedented control over their digital identities, seamlessly proving their qualifications and achievements in a digital age.

SunbirdED enables the user to earn digitally verifiable credentials in the form of Certificates. These certificates have QR codes that can be used to further verify user information. Sunbird ED allows the user to maintain their own digital passbook with all the credentials. Users can continue to hold these credentials against their profiles and also download them for offline usage as well.

This digital empowerment simplifies the process of proving qualifications for individuals, eliminating the need for physical document verification and reducing the risk of fraud. Moreover, verifiable credentials can be stored and managed in digital wallets or platforms like SunbirdED, providing users with control over their digital identities and the sharing of their credentials. For example, a professional could share their digital certificate of membership to a recognized industry body with prospective employers, or an individual could prove their attendance at a specialized training workshop with a scanned QR code, right from their smartphone. This innovation not only streamlines verification for the credential holder but also offers a seamless way for employers, educational institutions, and service providers to confirm the authenticity of claims made by an individual.
