### Overview

Furthermore, in compliance with Google Play's regulations, the inclusion of an account deletion feature for Android users has now been mandated.

### New Features

#### **1.** **Delete user functionality for Android users (**[**LR-683**](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/browse/LR-683)**)**

<details>

<summary>Details</summary>

Sunbird Mobile and Web app will comply with the [Google Play app's account deletion requirements](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13327111?hl=en#zippy=%2Cwhat-users-will-see-if-your-app-supports-account-deletion). It has mandated that if the app allows users to create their account, it must also allow users to request account deletion. This will establish transparency and give users control over their data.

The User Data policy's [Account Deletion Requirement](http://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13316080#account\_deletion) means that:&#x20;

1. All developers must complete new Data deletion questions in the Data safety form on the [**App content**](https://play.google.com/console/app/app-content/summary) page (Policy > App content) in Play Console.
2. If your app enables account creation, you must:
   * provide users with an in-app path to delete their app accounts and associated data; and&#x20;
   * provide a web link resource where users can request app account deletion and associated data deletion.&#x20;

#### **2.** Generalisation of Sunbird ED by r**emoval of hard-coded values in Mobile and Portal (**[**ED-1957**](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/browse/ED-1957)**,** [**ED-3042**](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/browse/ED-3042)**)**

<details>

<summary>Details</summary>

Previously, Sunbird ED supported only a single domain, i.e., Education. Now, adopters can create their framework and customise the features per their requirements.&#x20;

The features have been made dynamic by removing the hard-coded values in the portal and the mobile app.

#### **Note (only for existing adopters)**

1. **Portal -** Update the [menu bar forms](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUN/pages/3398729734/ED-Portal+Config+Changes+as+per+the+BMGS+Hardcoded+Removal#Menu-Bar-Form-Configuration-for-Sunbird-ED-\(BMGS\)-Reference).

From release-7.0.0, the hardcoding of ALL tab/global filters has been removed, and the menu bar forms have been modified within the ALL tab section inside the metadata object as `globalFilterConfig`

2. **Mobile -** Update the [framework config forms](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUN/pages/3452239908/Framework+Agnostics+Release+7.0.0#Form%3A-Framework\_update\_config).

Follow the links to configure the forms step-by-step for the [portal](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUN/pages/3434512396/ED-Portal+Framework+Agnostics+Release+7.0.0) and [mobile](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUN/pages/3452239908/Framework+Agnostics+Release+7.0.0#Form:-Framework\_update\_config).

### Enhancements/Technical Tasks

#### **1.** Improved file upload feedback **(**[**ED-1629**](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/browse/ED-1629)**)**

<details>

<summary>Details</summary>

Users will now see a pop-up message and an error icon if any files fail to upload when they submit or sync their projects. Users can also re-upload or remove the files with errors.

</details>

#### 2. Enhanced task end date validation ([ED-1373](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/browse/ED-1373))

<details>

<summary>Details</summary>

Users can now only set the task end date within the project start and end dates. Users will also get confirmation pop-ups if changing the project dates affects the task end dates.

</details>

#### 3. Enhanced content creation screen in Workspace ([ED-2429](https://project-sunbird.atlassian.net/browse/ED-2429))

<details>

<summary>Details</summary>

Currently, the workspace creation content is static and requires reconfiguration. To address this, the primary categories are made configurable.

A new form API that includes fields for code, category, and visibility to enable tile configuration is introduced. This will allow any adaptor to hide or modify categories without necessitating code changes in the future.
