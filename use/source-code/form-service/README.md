# Form service

**Sunbird-ED Forms API** is primarily used for **configuring and managing forms** within the Sunbird-ED platform. These forms are likely used for various purposes, such as:

* **User registration**
* **Content creation**
* **Feedback collection**
* **Other administrative tasks**

**Key functionalities of the API might include:**

* Creating, updating, and deleting form definitions.
* Managing form fields (text boxes, dropdowns, etc.) and their properties.
* Defining form layouts and structures.
* Handling form submissions and data processing.
* Integrating forms with other Sunbird-ED components.

#### How it Enables Dynamic Configuration

While the specific details of the API might vary, it's reasonable to assume that the Sunbird-ED Forms API provides mechanisms for:

* **Defining form templates:** Creating reusable form structures.
* **Customising form instances:** Populating form templates with specific data and configurations.
* **Managing form submissions and data:** Processing and storing form data.

By allowing for dynamic configuration of forms, the API can be used to create flexible and adaptable user interfaces within the Sunbird-ED platform.
