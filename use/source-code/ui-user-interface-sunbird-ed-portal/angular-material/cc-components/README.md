# CC Components

These components consist of shared UI elements developed with Angular. They are designed for use across Sunbird consumption platforms, such as mobile apps, web portals, and offline desktop applications. These components are created to enhance reusability and simplify maintenance.

### Info

In the beta version ([**v14-UI-angular-material-migration**](https://github.com/Sunbird-Ed/SunbirdEd-consumption-ngcomponents/tree/v14-UI-angular-material-migration)) of the SunbirdEd-consummption-ngcomponents, we implemented  Angular Material to enhance the user interface and improve the overall user experience. Despite the availability of several major Angular Material versions, including the latest v16.2.3, we chose to utilize [**version 14**](https://v14.material.angular.io/) for the SunbirdEd-consummption-ngcomponents.

To find installation instructions and details regarding the folder structure, kindly consult the sections in the installation and Theme Setup related to [**Angular Material**](../../../../developer-guide/ui-user-interface-sunbird-ed-portal/angular-material/) mentioned above.

Below, you'll find a list of key components implemented with Angular Material.
